# Introduction

Hi everyone, Patrick here! I hope you enjoyed the first post on the site. If you haven't gotten a change to read it and want to learn about an introductory classification method you can read more [here](/blog/logistic-regression-intro/). With that said, I do have a few ideas on the backburner that I thought I might give a heads up on.

# Current Ideas

- Intro to Numerical Integration
  - Overall a large topic, I'll be focusing on using them to solve ODEs of dynamical systems for simulation.
- PCA/LDA Dimensionality Reduction
  - I'll discuss two different methods of reducing the dimensionality of data.
  - Useful in reducing computation time for machine learning while retaining, if not improving, accuracy.
- Neural Network From Scratch
  - This is more of a longshot as I am personally learning much of this but I could introduce it as an extension to the prior logistic regression post.

# Recommendations

If you have any recommendations don't hesitate to get in touch!
